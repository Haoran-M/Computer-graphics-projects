<h4>Honor statement:</h4>
<p>I have not cheated in any way when doing this assignment, I did it on my own. 
  I may have asked questions about the assignment on Coursys, 
  I know that’s totally fine and even encouraged. 
  I also already know that this class is graded on a curve.
  I realize that if I cheat and by some miracle not get caught, 
  any increase in my grade will in turn shift the curve and result in lower grades for my classmates.
  Any undeserved extra grade would come at the cost of all others. 
  That’s horrible! I would never do it.</p>

<h4>4: Anti-aliasing</h4>

<p>The high pass image did not have much aliasing, the edges are blured and pixeled but smoothed well
  The frequency graph for the high pass image shows significant unbalanced energy,
  The axis on the frequency graph are blured and the center of the graph is dark, 
  this indicates the graph had some aliasing, but do to the load of edges on the graph,
   it did not have good aliasing.
  The low pass image did not have much change due to the minimal edges in the graph.
  The frequency domain has a bright center along with clear axis, 
  this shows the aliasing is very minimal, which is what i expect.

<p>The high pass image did not change much compared to the sub2 image,
  edges are more blured if we look closer, this is due to the shrink in size.
  the frequency domain was more darker compared with sub2, which shows a bit more aliasing then before.
  The low pass image remained the same, due to very few components on the picture,
  there are less things that got lost during the desizing. 
  The frequency domain looks the same compared with the sub2,
  however it was a bit brighter on the center and along the y axis.
  This indicates minimal aliasing.

<p>For the gaussian kernels i used 11,1.5 for sub2, and 21, 2 for sub4
  I used a smaller kernel for sub2 and a larger kernel for sub4 so they would have more effect on anti aliasing.
  the frequency domains shows that the anti aliasing did not go very well,
  we can see a very large center area on the graph, and thick axis representing poor anti aliasing.
  but comparing sub2 and sub4 we can see that the center of sub4 frequency graph is smaller then sub2
  and the axis are less thick compared to sub2, which shows we have improved anti aliasing on sub4. 
  It seems like the pictures before did not have much aliasing but when we applied the gaussian kernels
  The aliasing increased and anti aliasing did not make the graph better then before.
  Adding the gaussian filters increased aliasing as the components are more pixelized.

<img src="./CMPT 361 HW1 - Haoran Miao_files/HP-canny-highhigh.png" alt=" HP-canny-highhigh" width="300" height="300">
<p>i choose the matlab default threshold for the optimal threshold as it captures almost all of the edges for the pictures
  For the high high and low high, i can see some more edges are detected. 
  the picture for high pass is the picture of the sfu bullet board. 
  the high high and low high have detected some edges that are one the posters,
  these edges can and cannot be considered as edges.
  the high low and low low have extended and added more details on the missing edges.
  but the extending edges works on the edges on the posters as well with creates too many edges detected.

<p>same as the above i used matlabs default threshold for the optimal threshold.
  because the low pass picture does contain much detail the threshold for this are very small 
  the low low and low high did not have much of a difference compared with the optimal graph
  the image for the lowpass is an apple on the table 
  the low high and high high have detected more edges on the table,
  these edges are patterns of the wood, and could barly be seen on the original picture.
  The wrinkles on the apple have also been detected by all the methods.
